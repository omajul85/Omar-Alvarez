Bowling game

This solution has been developed in Ruby 1.93.

In order to run this game, you need to clone the repository and run
the file main.rb in a ruby console. Remark that you have to call the 
file from the src folder. Ex:

C:\Your path\Bowling\src>ruby main.rb

This solution is based on the Finite-state machine modeling.
